# These MySQL queries were used to clean and consolidate WordPress data into three views with data on:
<ul>
  <li>customer order histories</li>
  <li>popular products and variations</li>
  <li>customer loyalty</li>
</ul>

# The wpDataTables plugin was then used to visualize and synchronize the views with WordPress
